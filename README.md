It is important to keep in mind the business context when presenting your findings:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?


Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to. 


# SOLUTION BASED ON MY ANALYSIS

- According to the customer demographic study, potential customers from the list of new customers are those that fall into mass segments that include both men and women.

- Additionally, there are those clients who belong to the wealthy and high net worth demographics who contribute far more to sales than the majority of mass consumers. To keep such valuable consumers, a company must also identify them and offer thema personalized service.

- Therefore, all the marketing strategies should be designed in such a way that it will be targeted to these customers only as conversion rate is high with high ROI for such prospects.

- In order to increase the share of wallet of current customers as well as to draw in new customers, the company's top three brands -Solex, WeareA2B, and Giant bicycles-are preferred by the majority of their current customers. Therefore, sprocket central should adopt a differentiated market growth strategy by introducing new product lines under these successful brands' umbrellas with some differentiation in features or pricing or both, which will give them an advantage over rivals. 
- Companies may introduce product lines under these brands that will be premium offerings to their high-net-worth individuals and wealthy customers, thereby elevating their social status. They can also do this for some mass consumers who enjoy elevating their social status through the purchase of premium products.

- In order to increase income, the sprocket can cross-sell or upsell to their current clients. In addition, less profitable product lines, such as mountain and touring bicycles, should be discontinued as soon as possible. This will help the sprocket to continue
